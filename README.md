# Api

The objective of this repository is creating a REST API with CRUD operations  (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org">Django REST Framework</a>.

# Api's Schema

- `/restaurants/`: Here you can access to the main page of the Restaurant's API. 
- `/docs/`: Here you can find all the documentation of the API, and some examples of how to use it.
- `/schema/`: Here you can find the complete schema of the API.

## Examples

- GET ```curl --request GET \
  --url https://calm-wildwood-17330.herokuapp.com/restaurants/```
  
If you want test my app using POSTMAN check this<a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1727394/api/RW1boKPb"> link</a>

To make a POST, DELETE or PUT request you need to be authenticated. I create a dummy user for testing.
-user: user
-password: user12345678
